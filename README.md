This project uses **C++17** version, because **< filesystem >** library is available for **C++17 and newer version**.
Then you need to enable c++17 compiling.

1. In Visual Studio 2019, enter `Project Properties -> C/C++ -> Language -> C++ Language Standard`.

2. Put this command option: `/std:c++17 `

3. Try to build ! :)
